# Meme Generator

## Project Description
This is my first React project. In this lab, I built a webpack from scratch and created a WYSIWYG editor that allows user to create a meme image with text.

## Developer
Requires Node v10 or later.

### How to get started
* Fork repository, clone locally, navigate to repository directory,
* Download all the files with `npm i`,
* To test, run `npm test`. 

### How to use features
* Connect to server with `npm start`.
* Customize your meme by:
    * Editing the header and footer inputs,
    * Pick your font color and size,
    * Adding your own image via pasting a link in the text box or choosing a local file,
    - Known bug: local images will save better than certain links (CORS issue)
* Click `Save Meme!`.
