# Meme Generator

## Project Description
This is my first React project. In this lab, I built a webpack from scratch and created a WYSIWYG editor that allows user to create a meme image with text.

## Developer
Requires Node v10 or later.

### How to get started
* Fork repository, clone locally, navigate to repository directory,
* Download all the files with `npm i`,
* To test, run `npm test`. 

### How to use features
* Connect to server with `npm start`.
* Customize your meme by:
    * editing the header and footer inputs
    * adding your own image via the text box or choosing a local file
* Click `save meme!`.

- Known bug: local images will save better than links (CORS issue)
